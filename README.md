# applescript

I often find myself really annoyed with applications launching in giant windows. It's especially annoying when they cover up all of the Desktop, or more than 45% of the screen. It's annoying when they block stuff I'm doing.

I also find myself spending about 20 minutes every morning I'm teaching classes arranging windows on my second monitor. 

I made a script to help with the latter. The full story and use case is in the header comments. 

More little things to come, especially addessing my first frustration. I'd like to make a script that detects a window opening and sizes it to a bit under half of my screebn horizontally, with room on the ouside to access desktop icons and for space between windows, and to about 75% vertically, again leaving icons accessible and making it so I can  see the title bars of mutliple windows on each half.
